# Project 4 

### My Projects will have different hyperlinks with a quick detailed description of whatâ€™s in store. I want everything to be monochromatic but fun. I made my projects to be a little whimsy and fantasy-like with the subject, so i think by having it be grouped up in a way you can see the poems, then the video, then the game would do well. I want this portfolio to be the source of my creativity, and design. The portfolio will be the platform to access my work with quick drop down images and links to access it.
