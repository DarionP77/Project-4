# Project 4 

### My Projects will have different hyperlinks with a quick detailed description of whatâ€™s in store. I want my page to have images that are fun, that corelates to my diffrent projects. I made my projects to be a little whimsy and fantasy-like with the subject, so i think by having it be grouped up in a way you can see the poems, then the video, then the game would do well. I want this portfolio to be the source of my creativity, and design. The portfolio will be the platform to access my work with quick drop down images and links to access it. 

<h1>PROJECT 1: Github Poetry Website</h1>

# Project-2

I made my project a little skit of a zoom live stremaer doing a livestream for a visa gift card. 

Their will be 3 artworks shown using the green screen and will be a lot of funny streamer mommets that I tried to act out. 

By the way, the artworks shown in the video are all mad by your truly. Enjoy the video!

### In this project, I will showcase my ability to use Twine. This game is quite long, with 3 diffrent endings to it, and many of choices to choose from. Will you figure out what's going on in the creepy Tavern?
